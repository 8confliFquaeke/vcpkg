The Alfa Romeo 159 is a mid-size car that was produced by the Italian automaker Alfa Romeo from 2005 to 2011. It was designed by Giorgetto Giugiaro and the Alfa Romeo Style Center and was based on a common platform with the Alfa Romeo Brera and Spider models. The Alfa Romeo 159 was offered in two body styles: a four-door sedan and a five-door station wagon. It competed with other premium cars in its segment, such as the Audi A4, BMW 3 Series, Mercedes-Benz C-Class and Volvo S60.
 
The Alfa Romeo 159 was praised for its distinctive and elegant styling, its sporty handling and performance, its high-quality interior and its advanced safety features. It was also criticized for its high weight, its limited rear space and visibility, its high fuel consumption and emissions and its reliability issues. The Alfa Romeo 159 received several awards and recognitions, such as the Auto Europa award in 2006, the Car of the Year award in Croatia and Serbia in 2007, the Best Executive Car award in Ireland in 2008 and the Most Beautiful Car in the World award in China in 2010.
 
The Alfa Romeo 159 was replaced by the Alfa Romeo Giulia in 2016, which is a rear-wheel drive car that shares its platform with the Alfa Romeo Stelvio SUV. The Alfa Romeo Giulia is considered to be a more modern and competitive successor to the Alfa Romeo 159, as it offers improved performance, efficiency, technology and design. However, some fans and enthusiasts still prefer the Alfa Romeo 159 for its unique charm and character.
