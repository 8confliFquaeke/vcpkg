One of the best books on high voltage engineering is **High Voltage Engineering by M.Jeraldin Ahila**. This book covers the theoretical and practical aspects of high voltage engineering in a clear and concise manner. The book follows the syllabus of Anna University for the seventh semester of electrical engineering students. The book also contains numerous solved examples, exercises, objective questions and previous year question papers to help the readers test their knowledge and prepare for exams.
  
The book is divided into eight chapters that cover the following topics:
  
- Introduction to high voltage engineering: This chapter introduces the basic concepts, definitions, units and standards of high voltage engineering. It also discusses the sources and types of high voltages, such as AC, DC, impulse and switching voltages.
- High voltage generation: This chapter explains the methods and circuits for generating high AC, DC and impulse voltages. It also describes the measurement techniques and instruments for high voltages.
- High voltage testing: This chapter covers the various types of tests performed on electrical equipment and materials under high voltages. It also explains the test procedures, standards and specifications for high voltage testing.
- Breakdown mechanisms in gases: This chapter analyzes the physical phenomena and processes involved in the breakdown of gases under high voltages. It also discusses the factors affecting the breakdown strength and time lag of gases.
- Breakdown mechanisms in liquids and solids: This chapter examines the breakdown mechanisms in liquid and solid insulating materials under high voltages. It also covers the effects of moisture, temperature, impurities, aging and stress on the breakdown characteristics of liquids and solids.
- Insulation coordination: This chapter deals with the principles and methods of insulation coordination for power systems. It also covers the concepts of insulation levels, overvoltages, surge arresters, shielding and grounding.
- Lightning phenomena and protection: This chapter describes the nature and characteristics of lightning phenomena. It also explains the methods of lightning protection for power lines, substations, buildings and electronic equipment.
- High voltage applications: This chapter highlights some of the important applications of high voltages in various fields, such as electrostatic precipitation, electrostatic painting, electrostatic separation, corona discharge, ozone generation, X-ray production and particle accelerators.

The book is written in a simple and lucid language that makes it easy to understand for students and professionals alike. The book is also enriched with diagrams, tables, graphs and photographs that illustrate the concepts and examples clearly. The book is a valuable resource for anyone who wants to learn more about high voltage engineering.
